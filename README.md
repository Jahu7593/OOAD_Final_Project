## Sources / Attribution
We would like to thank Coding with Russ for providing the basic outline of our code and helping us learn pygame! His github handle is @russs123

## Instructions
The game window can be launched one of two ways:
1 - Run "python src/main.py"
2 - Run ".\cmd.bat" to generate an executable file "main.exe" which will open the game window (may take 10-20 seconds to load)

## Libraries
Pygame, PyInstaller (to generate exe), Python Random

## Git Instructions
Branch individual work: Add, Commit, and Push to origin "HEAD"
